    '''
    This function will take in the original user-item matrix and "mask" a percentage of the original ratings where a
    user-item interaction has taken place for use as a test set. The test set will contain all of the original ratings, 
    while the training set replaces the specified percentage of them with a zero in the original ratings matrix. 
    
    parameters: 
    
    ratings - the original ratings matrix from which you want to generate a train/test set. Test is just a complete
    copy of the original set. This is in the form of a sparse csr_matrix. 
    
    pct_test - The percentage of user-item interactions where an interaction took place that you want to mask in the 
    training set for later comparison to the test set, which contains all of the original ratings. 
    
    returns:
    
    training_set - The altered version of the original data with a certain percentage of the user-item pairs 
    that originally had interaction set back to zero.
    
    test_set - A copy of the original ratings matrix, unaltered, so it can be used to see how the rank order 
    compares with the actual interactions.
    
    user_inds - From the randomly selected user-item indices, which user rows were altered in the training data.
    This will be necessary later when evaluating the performance via AUC.
